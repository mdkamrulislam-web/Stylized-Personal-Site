                  Due to climate change effects, the demand for renewable energy is growing immensely around the world. Photovoltaic (PV) panels are widely popular as a vital source of renewable energy all over the world as well as in Bangladesh.However, besides solar irradiance, the panel output is greatly affected by some of the weather parameters like temperature, humidity, wind, etc. Reliable forecasting of PV panel output is essential for capacity planning in advance to efficiently manage the energy distribution. This paper presents a method to forecast the PV panel output energy using a machine learning model, known as the Prophet Model used for univariate time series forecasting. This paper presents a method to forecast the PV panel output energy using a machine learning model, known as the Prophet Model used for univariate time series forecasting. The results show the proposed forecasting method to be quite encouraging and reliable while providing a higher coefficient of determination value with an average of 0.9772 for one-day-ahead PV panel output energy forecasting.</p>

                  This study presents a short-term performance analysis of the photovoltaic (PV) module considering weather impact in the context of Bangladesh by using machine learning. A Multilayer perceptron model is used to analyze the data and to predict the output. To collect the weather data and the output data, a weather station has been developed and deployed on the rooftop of a 7-story building in Gabtoli, Dhaka, Bangladesh. All the sensor data can be accessed remotely. In this study data from 1st November 2019 to 28th February 2020 are used in four separate data set for training purposes. It is observed that the output energy prediction improves with the increase in training data. The result shows that the temperature has the highest linear correlation with the module short circuit current among all the weather parameters i.e. humidity, wind speed, and air pressure.</p>

                  Dust accumulation on photovoltaic (PV) modules causes a significant reduction in the electrical energy output by partially blocking the solar irradiance incident on the PV modules. The effect is more pronounced during the dry season when the environment is dustier. In this work, an investigation is conducted to understand how dust particles can affect the performance of the PV panels installed on the rooftop of a high-rise building during the dry season. Two monocrystalline 20W PV panels, deployed on the rooftop of a seven-story building in Gabtoli, Dhaka, Bangladesh, have been used for this purpose. Measurements are carried out over four months, starting from 1 st November 2019 to 29th February 2020, during which the weather remains mostly cold, dry, and dusty. It has been observed that dust accumulation monthly decreases the short-circuit current from a minimum of 5.52% to a maximum of 22.31% during this period. The maximum reduction in the daily output energy during this period is observed to be about 35%. The effect of dust has been observed to be most pronounced during December 2019, which shows a decrease of over 22% in total monthly energy output in the dusty panel compared to that of the clean panel.</p>
